# Malaysia Electricity Trend Analysis

This repository contains Python scripts and data analysis for visualizing key trends in Malaysia's electricity sector, focusing on generation, demand, imports, and power sector emissions by fuel type.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to provide a clear and insightful visualization of Malaysia's electricity landscape over time. It analyzes:

* **Annual Electricity Generation by Fuel Type:** Breaking down power generation into categories like Bioenergy, Coal, Gas, Hydro, Other Fossil, and Solar.
* **Total Electricity Generation, Demand, and Import:** Understanding the overall balance of electricity supply and consumption.
* **Power Sector Emissions:** Analyzing carbon emissions attributed to different fuel types in electricity generation.
* **Annual Changes/Growth Rates:** Identifying year-on-year percentage changes in key metrics.

The visualizations aim to highlight trends, dependencies on certain fuel types, and the ongoing challenges in decarbonization efforts within the Malaysian power sector.

## Data Sources

The data used in this analysis is sourced [Monthly electricity data - long format (CSV)](https://storage.googleapis.com/emb-prod-bkt-publicdata/public-downloads/monthly_full_release_long_format.csv). This dataset is made available by Ember on its website.
